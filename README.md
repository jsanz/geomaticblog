# Geomatic Blog

This is the content repository for <https://geomaticblog.net>, a blog about geospatial topics running since 2006. The repository has been created to host the content after many years as a WordPress installation. The website has been migrated to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and it is being published at [Netlify](https://netlify.com).

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/e4449a72-d055-448a-8bc6-505619f5509d/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/geomaticblog/deploys)

Some details:

* Since the migration was not completely clean, every old posnt offers a link to the Wayback Machine for convenience. Also old comments were not migrated and will only be accessible from the wayback machine.
* From now on, the website uses [utterances](https://utteranc.es/) to host blogpost comments as issues on the Github repository.
* To support multiple authors, a taxonomy has been implemented allowing to assign multiple authors to a single post, and group them altogether at the `/authors`  taxonomy page.
* Deploy previews are enabled for Pull Requests, allowing to inspect new features, fixes, and even blog drafts and reviews.

Check the [issues](https://github.com/jsanz/geomaticblog/issues) for reported problems that are still to iron out after the migration from wordpress.
