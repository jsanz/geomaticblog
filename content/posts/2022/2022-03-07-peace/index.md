It's not the way we'd like to start a new episode for this blog, but current events make this change so irrelevant that we may cover it some other time. It's heartbreaking to see the evolution of the invasion of a sovereign country, the destruction of so many lives. Our thoughts are with the displaced, and all the innocent people that are watching their world to fall apart.

There's not much to say, just stay safe and if you have any means, please give a hand to the extent of your capabilities.
