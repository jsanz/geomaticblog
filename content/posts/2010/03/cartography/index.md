[![Cartography](images/4424522328_a8df60cc42_o.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/xurxosanz/4424522328/ "Cartography by XuRxO, on Flickr")

A quick toy following [reidrac's meme](http://rambleon.usebox.net/post/437596709/self-motivator-programming-you-might-not-know) and to congratulate the discovery of the [Gim√©nez-Lorente Foundation website](http://fglorente.org/), it's so 90's but, damn, it's about four hundred years old maps!.

The web site is only in Spanish but you can point directly to the amazing [downloads section](http://fglorente.org/mapas.html) with great old maps.

The image was created with [wigflip.com/](http://wigflip.com/) using as Juanjo says, alien technology (Lisp).
