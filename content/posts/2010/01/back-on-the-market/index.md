After several years working for the same company, working in the same project for a regional administration, it seems that all the money has gone with the crisis. Therefore  I'm back on the (labor) market.

Far from seeing this as a trouble, I see it as a problem and an opportunity, not just for me but for any company or project that may be looking for a good "man in the middle" on geo-technologies.

- Good technical skills
- Focused on problem solving
- Good teammate
- +15 years of experience in informatics
- +10 years of experience in geomatics
- Open source GIS oriented, but who also understands proprietary GIS software
- With learning skills

You can also check my CV (in Spanish and English) at [http://pferrer.eurocv.eu](http://pferrer.eurocv.eu/)

CU in this cartographic world, which is certainly smaller than the subject that tries to represent.
