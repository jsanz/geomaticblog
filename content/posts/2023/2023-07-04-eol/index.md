[Vicente](/authors/vicente-bayarri/), [Pedro-Juan](/authors/pedro-juan-ferrer/), and me started this blog in [2006](https://web.archive.org/web/20090207135426/http://geomaticblog.net/node/7). Back then blogs were the best way to create content and share knowledge. It was the times of RSS, Google Reader, social bookmarking through `del.icio.us`, and pictures on `Flickr`. Very different from these days of micro-blogging, quick videos, influencers moving from one platform to another chasing their viewers' attention and money, newsletters under paywalls, etc. 

We stayed for a few months in a self-hosted [Drupal CMS](https://www.drupal.org/) but maintaining it was a pain, so we moved to a [managed Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/) where we lived most of the time. Wordpress offered an excellent balance to get [us](/authors/) writing without much hassle, keeping our domain, and very infrequent ads. Finally, last year I migrated the content to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static generator, to save some costs, but the decline in writing started in 2018, so it is OK to close this project formally.

I will keep the blog code and content on a GitHub repository at https://github.com/jsanz/geomaticblog/ where we have posts in Markdown since 2007, and everything is hopefully for ever available in the web archive at <https://web.archive.org/web/20130801000000*/http://geomaticblog.net/>. I will probably copy my posts to my [website](https://jorgesanz.net).

Needless to say that we are forever grateful to those that encouraged us to write here. I had a lot of fun maintaining the website and writing content for everyone else.
We are easy to find on the Internet, so please contact us anytime!

Have fun!
