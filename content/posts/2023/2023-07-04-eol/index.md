[Vicente](/authors/vicente-bayarri/), [Pedro-Juan](/authors/pedro-juan-ferrer/), and me started this blog in [2006](https://web.archive.org/web/20090207135426/http://geomaticblog.net/node/7). Back then blogs were the best way to create content and share knowledge. It was the times of RSS, Google Reader, social bookmarking through `del.icio.us`, and  pictures on `Flickr`. Very different from these days of microblogging, quick videos, influencers moving from one platform to another chasing their viewers attention and money, newsletters under paywalls, etc. 

We stayed for a few months in a self-hosted [Drupal CMS](https://www.drupal.org/) but maintaining it was a pain so we moved to a [managed Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/) where we lived for the most of the time. Wordpress offered a good balance to get [us](/authors/) writing without much hassle, keeping our domain, and very infrequent ads. Finally last year I did the migration of the content to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static generator, to save some costs, but the decline in writing really started back in 2018 so it is OK to formally close this project.

I will keep the blog code and content on a Github repository at <https://github.com/jsanz/geomaticblog/> were we have posts in Markdown since 2007, and everything is hopefully for ever available in the web archive at <https://web.archive.org/web/20130801000000*/http://geomaticblog.net/>. I will probably copy my own posts to my [personal website](https://jorgesanz.net).

Needless to say that we are forever grateful to those that encouraged us to write here. I had a lot of fun maintaining the website and writing content for me and everyone else.

We are pretty easy to find on the Internet so feel free to contact us anytime!

Have fun!
