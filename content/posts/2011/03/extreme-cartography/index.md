People are coming home after a great [Spanish FOSS4G meeting](http://www.sigte.udg.edu/jornadassiglibre/). There will be time to write about the event, here or maybe on my [Prodevelop blog](http://www.prodevelop.es/es/blog/jsanz), but before that, I really want to share with you this nice piece of art by [RealIvanSanchez](http://twitter.com/RealIvanSanchez) and [Vehrka](http://twitter.com/Vehrka). Planet readers follow [this link](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6OFCIir6XU) as Planet software eats videos for breakfast.

If you understand Spanish, you should wait for the publishing of meeting videos and see the complete presentation of Iván explaining what Extreme Cartography means to him.

What will [GEOHULK](http://twitter.com/HULKGEO) think about this?
