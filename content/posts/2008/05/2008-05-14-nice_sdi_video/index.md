Pretty instructive and nice video about the Spanish SDI ([IDEE](http://www.idee.es/show.do?to=pideep_pidee.EN "Spanish SDI project")). Congratulations to the [IGN](http://www.ign.es/ign/es/IGN/home.jsp "Spanish Geographic National Institute") people (who I suppose have produced the video). Its in English and in Spanish so that's why I post it in English to spread it more to our non Spanish eventual readers ;)

The video is not on the post header to avoid planet readers trouble
