title: About us
---


[geomatic blog](http://geomaticblog.net) started in 2006. Our first year was lost on one of the earliest migrations but is still available at the [wayback machine](http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://geomaticblog.net)). This was an idea from three university mates but over the years new friends have joined the effort and actually everyone is welcomed. If you have anything interesting to write about just contact us!! Most of the content of the blog is in Spanish but we are moving to English, and even we write here seldom, at least we'll try to maximize our audience. Thanks for visiting us!
